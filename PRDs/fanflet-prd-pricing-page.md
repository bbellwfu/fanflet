# PRD: Marketing Site — Pricing Page
**Version:** 1.0 — Draft  
**Date:** February 17, 2026  
**Author:** Brian (Product) / Claude (Documentation)  
**Status:** Draft for Review

---

## 1. Overview & Purpose

### What This Page Does
A pricing page on the Fanflet marketing website that communicates three things:

1. Fanflet is currently in an **early release phase** and access is **free for a limited time**.
2. Here's what you get today — a clear summary of the platform's current capabilities.
3. **Paid tiers are coming** — but without specifics on pricing, feature differentiation, or timelines.

### Why It Matters Now
Fanflet needs a pricing page for two reasons:

- **Credibility:** Visitors to a marketing site expect a pricing page. Its absence can signal that the product isn't serious or isn't ready. Even a simple page establishes legitimacy.
- **Expectation setting:** If people start using Fanflet for free and are later surprised by paid tiers, that creates friction. Signaling early that paid plans are coming — while rewarding early adopters — builds trust and positions the transition as expected, not disruptive.

### Strategic Context
The pricing page deliberately avoids locking in tier names, pricing, or feature splits. The product's tier structure is still being defined (and may be influenced by decisions around the paywall/monetization platform — see brainstorm item 8). This page is designed to be **easy to update** once those decisions are made, without requiring a redesign.

## 2. User Stories

- **As a prospective user**, I want to understand what Fanflet costs, so I can decide whether to sign up.
- **As a prospective user**, I want to know what features I get today, so I understand the value of the platform.
- **As a prospective user**, I want to know if pricing will change in the future, so I'm not caught off guard.
- **As a current user**, I want to see that my early adoption is valued, so I feel good about having joined early.

## 3. Page Requirements

### 3.1 Page Structure

The page should have four sections, in this order:

**Section 1 — Headline & Early Access Message**
- A clear headline that communicates: Fanflet is free right now during early access.
- A brief subheadline or paragraph reinforcing that this is a limited-time opportunity — early adopters get full access at no cost.
- Tone: confident, generous, not desperate. This isn't a "beta" apology — it's an invitation.

**Section 2 — What's Included Today**
- A short descriptive paragraph summarizing what Fanflet does (for visitors who may have landed on this page directly).
- A concise feature list (6–10 items) showing what's available in the current free tier.
- Features should be described in benefit-oriented language, not technical jargon.

**Section 3 — Future Plans Teaser**
- A brief section acknowledging that paid plans (e.g., "Pro") are on the horizon.
- Keep it intentionally vague: no pricing, no feature comparison, no timeline.
- Tone: "We're building more — stay tuned" not "Here's exactly what's coming."
- Should feel like a teaser, not a commitment.

**Section 4 — Call to Action**
- A clear CTA to sign up / get started for free.
- Optional: a secondary CTA to join a mailing list or follow for updates on future plans.

### 3.2 What NOT to Include

- No specific pricing for any tier (free or paid)
- No feature comparison grid between tiers
- No specific tier names beyond a general reference to "Pro" or "premium" plans
- No timeline for when paid tiers launch
- No details on what features will be paid vs. free
- No "beta" language — this is an "early release" or "early access," not a beta

### 3.3 Design & Tone Guidelines

- **Tone:** Confident, clean, straightforward. Fanflet is a real product, not an experiment.
- **Design:** Should match the existing marketing site's visual language. Simple layout — this is not a complex page.
- **Mobile-friendly:** Must work well on mobile; many KOLs will check this on their phones.
- **Easy to update:** The page structure should accommodate adding real tier cards and a comparison grid later without a full redesign.

## 5. Technical Notes

- This is a **static marketing page** — no dynamic content, no authentication required.
- Should be added to the existing marketing site navigation (likely as a top-level "Pricing" link).
- The page should be built in a way that tier cards (with pricing, feature grids, and CTAs per tier) can be added later without restructuring the page.
- SEO: Page title should include "Pricing" for discoverability. Suggested: "Pricing — Fanflet | Free During Early Access."
- Analytics: Track page visits and CTA click-through rate (both sign-up and mailing list subscribe).
- Mailing list: Requires an email capture mechanism — either a simple form that stores emails in the Fanflet database, or integration with a third-party email service. The mailing list should be usable for future product announcements, not just pricing updates.

---

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Page visits:** Are people finding and viewing the pricing page?
- **CTA conversion:** What percentage of pricing page visitors click through to sign up?
- **Mailing list signups:** How many visitors subscribe for updates? This is a leading indicator of interest from people not yet ready to commit.
- **Reduced support questions about pricing:** Does having this page decrease inbound "is this free?" or "what does it cost?" inquiries?

---

## 7. Future Considerations

When the tier structure is finalized, this page will evolve to include:

- Named tier cards (e.g., Free, Pro, Enterprise or similar)
- Pricing per tier
- Feature comparison grid
- Toggle for monthly vs. annual billing (if applicable)
- Possibly a "grandfathering" or early-adopter discount message for existing users

The current page structure is designed to make that transition straightforward.

---

## 8. Open Questions

1. **Early adopter discount mechanics (decided later):** We've committed to offering early adopters a discount on future paid plans. The specific discount amount, structure (percentage off, months free, grandfathered rate, etc.), and eligibility criteria (sign-up date cutoff) will be defined when the tier structure is finalized. For now, the promise is intentionally unspecified — we just need to track who qualifies as an "early access" user so we can honor it later.

2. **Mailing list implementation (decided — include it):** The page will include a secondary CTA to subscribe for updates on new features and paid plans. Open sub-questions: Should this be a simple email capture that we manage ourselves, or integrate with a third-party tool (e.g., Mailchimp, Buttondown, ConvertKit)? Given that 3rd-party integrations like Mailchimp are on the roadmap anyway (brainstorm item 5), it may make sense to stand one up now for our own use and dog-food it.

3. ~~**Feature list accuracy:**~~ Resolved — feature list confirmed by Brian.

4. **"Pro" naming:** The draft uses "Pro" as a placeholder for the paid tier. Is this the direction we want, or should we use something more generic like "premium plans"?
